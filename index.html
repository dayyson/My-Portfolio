        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I have recently took the first steps of my software development career by completing and graduating from the Just IT Software Skills Bootcamp.
            Working with knowledgeable, professional trainers and like-minded talented students helped me gain the skills and understanding of programming I have today.
            I am now seeking employment in the software development sector as an apprentice and hope to have a long lasting career as a highly professional, successful and accurate software developer.</p>
            <p>My main interests are; coding, playing video games, football and spending time with family and friends.</p>
            <p>I took a year out from education after completing my A-Levels as I was not sure what path I wanted to take in life, however I now know it's in coding :) </p>
